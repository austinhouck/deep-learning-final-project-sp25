The suspected shooter was 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, a man McCluskey\u2019s family said she had recently stopped dating. Rowland\u2019s body was found a few hours later at a church; police said he died by suicide.\nAt a press conference, university police chief Dale Brophy said that McCluskey had filed a police report with them \u201con Oct. 12 and Oct. 13\u201d about threats from Rowland. There was \u201csome follow-up\u201d and it was assigned to a detective who was \u201cworking to build a case against our suspect at that time,\u201d Brophy said. The police chief would not go into further details about what happened with that investigation.\nOn Monday night, Brophy said that police got a call from a frantic mother saying \u201csomething happened to her daughter.\u201d In a statement released by the McCluskey family, McCluskey\u2019s mother said that she was on the phone with her daughter that night when she suddenly heard Lauren McCluskey yell \u201cno no no!\u201d Afraid her daughter was in a car accident, she stayed on the line while her husband called 911. A few minutes later, the family statement said, \u201ca young woman picked up the phone and said all of Lauren\u2019s things were on the ground.\u201d It was the last time she spoke with her daughter.\nPolice officers went to the parking lot and found McCluskey\u2019s body, Brophy said. The university issued an alert and an order for students to \u201csecure-in-place.\u201d It was lifted at 11:46 p.m., according to the university\u2019s website, after police determined that Rowland was no longer on campus. Brophy said that Rowland was picked up by a vehicle and, about 1:15 a.m. he was spotted by Salt Lake City police who ran after him. Rowland got inside the Trinity AME Church, where he killed himself. A retired pastor told the Salt Lake Tribune that, to the best of his knowledge, Rowland didn\u2019t attend the church and he had no idea why he chose that building.\nThe family of McCluskey, 21, said that their daughter had dated Rowland for about a month. She ended the relationship after she learned about his criminal history.\nLauren was a senior student athlete on the University of Utah track team. She was an outstanding student with a 3.75 GPA majoring in Communication and was excited to graduate in May 2019. She was a 2015 honors graduate of Pullman High School where she was Washington state champion in the high jump and the school record holder in the 100 meter hurdles. She attended Capital Church in Salt Lake City. She loved to sing and had strength and determination. She was dearly loved and will be greatly missed.\nPolice said the two had been in a \u201cprior relationship,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t comment further. According to Utah Department of Corrections, Rowland was convicted in 2004 of enticing a minor, a second-degree felony, and attempted forcible sexual abuse, a third-degree felony. His last known home, Brophy said, was a halfway house.",
