# Cornell Deep Learning Final Project - Spring 2025

## Introduction
- Purpose of this Git repo (mention how this is a project that attempts to re-implement your paper of choice)
- Introduce the paper chosen and its main contribution.

## Chosen Result
- Identify the specific result you aimed to reproduce and its significance in the context of the paper’s main contribution(s).
- Include the relevant figure, table, or equation reference from the original paper.

## GitHub Contents
- Make a brief note about the content structure of your project

## Re-implementation Details
- Describe your approach to re-implementation or experimentation.
- Include key details about models, datasets, tools, and evaluation metrics.
- Mention any challenges or modifications made to the original approach.

## Reproduction Steps
As meta as this section is, it essentially documents steps someone would need to follow to implement your GitHub repo in a local environment.
- Describe ”how someone using your GitHub can re-implement your re-implementation?”
- Provide instructions for running your code, including any dependencies, required libraries, and command-line arguments.
- Specify the computational resources (e.g., GPU) needed to reproduce your results.

## Results/Insights
- Present your re-implementation results as a comparison to the original paper’s findings. Describes ”what can someone expect as the end-result of using your GitHub repo?”

## Conclusion
- Summarize the key takeaways from your re-implementation effort and the lessons learned.

## References
- Include a list of references, including the original paper and any additional resources used in your re-implementation.

## Acknowledgements
- Recognition goes a long way in setting up the context of your work. Your acknowledgements also act as an indirect validation about the quality of the work. For eg. having done this project as part of coursework is a sign that the work was potentially peer-reviewed or graded - i.e. added authenticity.
