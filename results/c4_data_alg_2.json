Rowland\u2019s body was found a few hours later at a church; police said he died by suicide.\nAt a press conference, university police chief Dale Brophy said that McCluskey had filed a police report with them \u201con Oct. 12 and Oct. 13\u201d about threats from Rowland.

A few minutes later, the family statement said, \u201ca young woman picked up the phone and said all of Lauren\u2019s things were on the ground.\u201d It was the last time she spoke with her daughter.\nPolice officers went to the parking lot and found McCluskey\u2019s body, Brophy said.

She ended the relationship after she learned about his criminal history.\nLauren was a senior student athlete on the University of Utah track team. She was an outstanding student with a 3.75 GPA majoring in Communication and was excited to graduate in May 2019. She was a 2015 honors graduate of Pullman High School where she was Washington state champion in the high jump and the school record holder in the 100 meter hurdles.

She was dearly loved and will be greatly missed.\nPolice said the two had been in a \u201cprior relationship,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t comment further.
